## Setting up Server
MySQL Server will need to be set up set up with legacy password protection with
- username: "root"
- password: ""  

Run init.js before first run of server

run `npm install` to install server dependecies (see server/package.json)
then `npm start` to serve on localhost:80, may need to edit server/package.json to add `sudo` to nodemon command for POSIX
